# TOY_DNN
Thanks [@Dynmi](https://github.com/Dynmi) for helping.  
It should save in my another repository [`homework`](https://github.com/Access-Rend/homework), but it's too large for me to write it correctly at once.  
Later I'll push the **key code** to that repository[`homework`](https://github.com/Access-Rend/homework) for other viewers, after finish this.  
So I wanna write this DNN as a c++ library for my interest.  
Now it hasn't been optimized in code or calculation.  
orz...
