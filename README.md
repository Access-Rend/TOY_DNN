# TOY_DNN
It should save in my another repository `homework`, but it's too large for me to write it correctly at once.
Later I'll push the **key code** to that repository(`homework`) for other viewers, after finish this.
So I wanna write this DNN as a c++ library for my interest.
Now it hasn't been optimized in code or calculation.
orz...
